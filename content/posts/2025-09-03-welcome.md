# Welcome to My Rust Blog

Hello and welcome to my new blog built with **Rust**! This is my first post to test out the static site generator I've been working on.

## What This Blog Is About

This blog will cover:

- Learning Rust programming
- Web development with Rust
- Static site generation
- Personal projects and experiments

## Features of This Blog System

- **Markdown Support**: Write posts in Markdown with YAML frontmatter
- **Static Generation**: Fast, lightweight static HTML files
- **Development Server**: Live preview during development
- **Simple & Clean**: Minimal but elegant design

## Getting Started

To create a new post, simply add a new Markdown file in the `content/posts/` directory with the following format:

```markdown
---
title: "Your Post Title"
date: "YYYY-MM-DD"
author: "Your Name"
tags: ["tag1", "tag2"]
---

Your content here...
```

That's it! The blog generator will take care of the rest.

Happy blogging! ðŸ¦€
