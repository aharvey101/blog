# Building a Static Site Generator in Rust

Today I want to share my experience building a simple static site generator using Rust.

## Why Rust for Static Site Generation?

Rust is an excellent choice for building static site generators because:

1. **Performance**: Rust's zero-cost abstractions mean fast compilation times
2. **Safety**: Memory safety without garbage collection
3. **Ecosystem**: Great crates like `pulldown-cmark` for Markdown parsing
4. **Cross-platform**: Works everywhere Rust works

## Key Components

Our static site generator has these main components:

### Markdown Parsing
We use the `pulldown-cmark` crate to parse Markdown content:

```rust
use pulldown_cmark::{Parser, html};

let parser = Parser::new(markdown_content);
let mut html_content = String::new();
html::push_html(&mut html_content, parser);
```

### YAML Frontmatter
Posts include metadata in YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: "Post Title"
date: "2025-09-02"
author: "Author Name"
tags: ["tag1", "tag2"]
---
```

### Template System
This uses Tera for templating
